What is the npm ci?
npm clean install: 
    -> npm install // just like this we do 
    -> npm ci // For clean installation of all packages.

If any problem comes while installation of any package (we have during npx prisma init).
So just delete package.json and do (npm ci).

----------------------
Setting up Prisma
    npm i prisma
    npx prisma init.

Prisma creates .env file by self and .gitignore also (if dont find in the current folder).
So we have to delete prisma created or our created file any of them create .env and .gitignore file. Which ever we want.

Run your prisma commands inside src folder.

Prisma Client:
    npm install @prisma/client

    remove this line from generator client because   "output   = "../src/generated/prisma"" output folder will be in node modules folder so dont need.

    Install Prisma client extention in vscode to see .prisma file systex formatting n all.

Prisma Migration:
https://www.prisma.io/docs/orm/prisma-migrate/getting-started
After writing model inside schema.prisma need to use below command to inialise your tables to database .
    prisma migrate dev --name init 
        ->if fails
    npx prisma migrate dev --name init 
        -> Because prisma gloablly is not installed but installed in project so we use npx to use any project installed pkg in cmd.

    Now check databse your table is created
        Want to add any field
        npx prisma migrate dev --name init added_total_guests_to_bookings

    If want to delete any column / down Migration
        https://www.prisma.io/docs/orm/prisma-migrate/workflows/generating-down-migrations

Generate your models inside nodemodules and Sync your tables to prisma clint to use table in code as model:
    npx prisma generate

    ex: 
        client.ts
            import { PrismaClient } from "@prisma/client";
            export default new PrismaClient();
        repository.ts
            import PrismaClient from "../prisma/client";
            PrismaClient.booking.create

Whenever you want to add new table just write your model in schema.prisma and run migration command.
