npm i mysql2 sequelize
npm i -D sequelize-cli
cd src
npx sequelize-cli init // creates models, seeders, migrations, and config folders and some files in src folder.

NOTE: do not focus on index.js file inside models folder it is auto generated and not used by our project.
    we can aslo customize this command.

    Create a file .sequelizerc and configure that. then run this command again.

Install mysql server (password: As810966@gmail) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nj3nBCwZaqI 
and workbench https://youtu.be/vQPBNCvboSo?si=J5Etvq7pjUfXXbIw

if error while mysql server check 
    anilkumarsen@Anils-MacBook-Pro ~ % mysql -u root -p             
    zsh: command not found: mysql

    try with this command 
        /usr/local/mysql/bin/mysql -u root -p
        if runs just set your new path 

        open > touch ~/.zshrc 
        Add this line below
        export PATH="/usr/local/mysql/bin:$PATH"

Create your database and add credentials in config file.

Now create migration
    npx sequelize-cli migration:generate --name create-hotel-table

    up: make new changes in the database
    down: revert the changes (rollback)

    We can write raw queries and ts like code as well.


Now run the created migration
    npx sequelize-cli db:migrate

Migration to add column
    npx sequelize-cli migration:generate --name add-rating-to-hotel-table 
    npx sequelize-cli migration:generate --name create-room-category-table 
    npx sequelize-cli migration:generate --name add-room-category-association 
    npx sequelize-cli migration:generate --name add-room-category-hotel-association 
    npx sequelize-cli migration:generate --name add-hotel-room-association 

We can also revert one specific migration and all the migration to come to initial state.
    npx sequelize-cli db:migrate:undo:all --to XXXXXXXXXXXXXX-create-posts.js
    npx sequelize-cli db:migrate:undo:all

To undo migration
    npx sequelize-cli db:migrate:undo

workbench
    create database airbnb_dev;

    use airbnb_dev;
    show tables;

    desc hotels;

    select * from SequelizeMeta; // Shows versions of tables

Sequelize migrations does not directly supports ts configurations and migrations files so we create sequelize.config.js file under config folder.
sequelize paranoid: 

Hooks: Function which are called before/after any call in database.
https://sequelize.org/docs/v6/other-topics/hooks/

Creation Attributes:
    In sequelize: the atrributes which are definetly required for Creation of a Model that we can define using infracreation attribute in model. 
Partial: 
    We use Partial because we may update one or all fields, so we can use some part of the whole object.
ModelStatic: 
    ModelStatic is used to define the type of a model class like Hotel, not an instance. It's helpful when you're passing or assigning Sequelize models and want to preserve type safety.

N+1 Query problem:

Cretion of rooms:
 1. Pass category id,
 2. Create rooms for all hotels which are there in that category for all dates.
 3. Create rooms in batch of given batch size 
 4. Looping to create rooms for all hotels that falls inside that category will be done by date wise.
 5. jobData.batchSize is for creating how many days ahead
  Ex. if start date is 1 Aug and batch size is 10 so it will be going to 1 Aug to 11 Aug
