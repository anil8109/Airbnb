npm i mysql2 sequelize
npm i -D sequelize-cli
cd src
npx sequelize-cli init // creates models, seeders, migrations, and config folders and some files in src folder.

NOTE: do not focus on index.js file inside models folder it is auto generated and not used by our project.
    we can aslo customize this command.

    Create a file .sequelizerc and configure that. then run this command again.

Install mysql server (password: As810966@gmail) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nj3nBCwZaqI 
and workbench https://youtu.be/vQPBNCvboSo?si=J5Etvq7pjUfXXbIw

if error while mysql server check 
    anilkumarsen@Anils-MacBook-Pro ~ % mysql -u root -p             
    zsh: command not found: mysql

    try with this command 
        /usr/local/mysql/bin/mysql -u root -p
        if runs just set your new path 

        open > touch ~/.zshrc 
        Add this line below
        export PATH="/usr/local/mysql/bin:$PATH"

Create your database and add credentials in config file.

Now create migration
    npx sequelize-cli migration:generate --name create-hotel-table

    up: make new changes in the database
    down: revert the changes (rollback)

    We can write raw queries and ts like code as well.


Now run the created migration
    npx sequelize-cli db:migrate

Migration to add column
    npx sequelize-cli migration:generate --name add-rating-to-hotel-table 
    npx sequelize-cli migration:generate --name create-room-category-table 
    npx sequelize-cli migration:generate --name add-room-category-association 
    npx sequelize-cli migration:generate --name add-room-category-hotel-association 
    npx sequelize-cli migration:generate --name add-hotel-room-association 

We can also revert one specific migration and all the migration to come to initial state.
    npx sequelize-cli db:migrate:undo:all --to XXXXXXXXXXXXXX-create-posts.js
    npx sequelize-cli db:migrate:undo:all

To undo migration
    npx sequelize-cli db:migrate:undo

workbench
    create database airbnb_dev;

    use airbnb_dev;
    show tables;

    desc hotels;

    select * from SequelizeMeta; // Shows versions of tables

Sequelize migrations does not directly supports ts configurations and migrations files so we create sequelize.config.js file under config folder.
sequelize paranoid: 

Hooks: Function which are called before/after any call in database.
https://sequelize.org/docs/v6/other-topics/hooks/

Creation Attributes:
    In sequelize: the atrributes which are definetly required for Creation of a Model that we can define using infracreation attribute in model. 
Partial: 
    We use Partial because we may update one or all fields, so we can use some part of the whole object.
ModelStatic: 
    ModelStatic is used to define the type of a model class like Hotel, not an instance. It's helpful when you're passing or assigning Sequelize models and want to preserve type safety.
